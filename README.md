# Speech Recognition using Python and Assembly AI API üé§üîäüë®‚Äçüíª

### Welcome to my repository on Speech Recognition using Python and Assembly AI API! Here, I have shared my learnings and projects related to the basics of speech recognition using Python language. üöÄ

## About Speech Recognition
Speech recognition, also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), is the ability of a computer to recognize and transcribe spoken language into text. Speech recognition has a wide range of applications, including virtual assistants, speech-to-text transcription, and dictation.

## Projects Included
In this repository, I have worked on three different projects using Assembly AI API for speech recognition:

Basics of Audio Processing - In this project, I have learned about the basics of audio processing using Python, including how to read an audio file, extract features from the audio signal, and visualize the audio signal.

Audio File to Text Conversion - In this project, I have worked on converting an audio file into text using Python and Assembly AI API. The project includes steps to upload an audio file, transcribe the audio file into text, and store the text in a text file.

Youtube Sentiment Analysis - In this project, I have performed sentiment analysis on a YouTube video's transcript using Python and Assembly AI API. The project includes steps to extract the transcript from a YouTube video, perform sentiment analysis using the Assembly AI API, and visualize the results.

How to Use this Repository
To use this repository, you can clone it to your local machine and follow the instructions in the individual project folders. You will need to install the necessary dependencies for each project and obtain an API key from Assembly AI to use their API.

Acknowledgements
I learned the basics of speech recognition and completed these projects through the FreeCodeCamp course on YouTube. I would like to thank FreeCodeCamp and Assembly AI for providing the necessary resources to complete these projects.

Feel free to explore this repository and use the projects for your own learning and development. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out! ü§ñ
