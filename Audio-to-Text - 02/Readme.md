# Audio File to Text Conversion using Python 🎤📝🐍

## Welcome to the "Audio File to Text Conversion using Python" project! 🚀

In this project, I have worked on converting an audio file into text using Python and Assembly AI API. 
Here is a brief summary of what I have covered in this project:

Project Overview
This project is aimed at teaching how to convert an audio file into text using Python and Assembly AI API. It covers the process of uploading an audio file, transcribing the audio file into text using the Assembly AI API, and storing the text in a text file.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies to be installed:

1. requests: For making HTTP requests to the Assembly AI API
2. Audio File Transcription

The project covers the following aspects of audio file transcription:

1. Uploading an audio file to the Assembly AI API
2. Transcribing the audio file into text using the Assembly AI API
3. Storing the text in a text file using Python's pathlib module

## Conclusion

This project is a great starting point for those interested in learning about audio file transcription using Python and Assembly AI API. With the knowledge gained from this project, one can explore more advanced techniques in the field of speech recognition and audio signal processing. 🎤📝🐍
