# Basics of Audio Processing using Python 🎧🔊🐍

Welcome to the "Basics of Audio Processing using Python" project! 🚀

In this project, I have learned about the basics of audio processing using Python. Here is a brief summary of what I have covered in this project:

## Project Overview
This project is aimed at teaching the fundamentals of audio processing using Python. It covers various aspects such as reading an audio file, extracting features from the audio signal, and visualizing the audio signal.

### Dependencies
The project requires the following dependencies to be installed:

NumPy: For numerical computations

Matplotlib: For visualizing the audio signal

Audio Signal Processing

## The project covers the following aspects of audio signal processing:

1. Reading an audio file using Python's wave module
2. Extracting the sample rate and sample width of the audio signal
3. Converting the audio signal to a NumPy array
4. Visualizing the audio signal using Matplotlib

## Conclusion

This project is a great starting point for those interested in learning about audio processing using Python. 
With the knowledge gained from this project, one can explore more advanced techniques in the field of speech recognition and audio signal processing. 🎤🐍🔊
